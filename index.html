When he met us, he told us that he tried to dodge the bouncer, but the ball hit his left eye. Post-injury, he gradually started losing vision in his left eye and started to feel heaviness around the eye and forehead. When we saw him, a large hemorrhagic choroidal detachment was noted in the left eye in the temporal area, which was confirmed on ultrasonography (B Scan). Since he was young and apprehensive, he wanted immediate evacuation of the blood. We counseled him to calm down and explained to him regarding the condition and started on medical treatment. Usually, most of these bleeds reduce over a period of time with medical therapy, just that it requires constant monitoring. He understood the pros and cons well and was under regular follow up. Three weeks later, his vision returned to 6/6 and the choroidal detachment settled well with no trace of blood underneath!

After thorough counseling and assurance, we operated him with a vitrectomy with a scleral tear repair and took the iron spring coil out of the eye. The surgery nearly took 2 hours and that was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. His wife was in tears when we told them we had succeeded.

On that particular gloomy day, in the midst of a tense moment, he accidentally gulped it down his throat! Since the cover choked his throat really tight, he reflexively vomited it out. Unfortunately, that vomit reflex was so strong that the pressure in his eyes shot up and he landed up with a bleed inside his retina, something medically termed as “Valsalva Retinopathy”. On examination, it was noted that the bleed was over the fovea, the most important part of the retina which is responsible for fine vision. On further testing with the OCT, it was confirmed that the bleed was under the Internal limiting membrane (ILM). Basically, our retina has 10 layers, and ILM is the first and inner most layer of the retina. Not a very common thing that happens! The decision was taken to observe the bleed for a week and if it wouldn’t resolve by itself till then, we would opt for surgery to remove it. The vision over the week deteriorated and the color of the bleed began to change, indicating clotting tendency! Since we were planning to operate at the most sensitive area of the retina, we clearly explained him the pros and cons of surgery. Today, the young chap, with a smile on his face, returned to the OPD with a vision of 6/6 N6, a box of mouth watering homemade pedas (yeah of course, COVID times!), and a result of his exam!

With the help of clinical acumen and OCT, a diagnosis of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy was established. Such a case usually responds very well to Anti VEGF injections. The patient was clearly explained that multiple injections would be needed at a regular interval, otherwise the chances of recurrence goes up. Unfortunately after taking the first injection, the patient had some family issues for which he could not come timely for the second injection. He came 3 months later with a re-bleed which was highly expected. I sat down with him, explained him the gravity of the situation and possible loss of complete vision if treatment was hindered with. He then went ahead with 3 more injections at an interval of 3 months. Today, his vision has improved to 6/18 with a small area of scarring over the macula. Now he is on a regular follow up and makes sure he educates others too regarding the importance of timely treatment in retinal diseases!</h2><h3>Catagory :<span>AGE-RELATED-MACULAR-DEGENERATION</span></h3></div></div><div class="work-info" id="ARMD2"><div class="work-info-img" style="background:url(w02.png);background-size:cover"></div><div class="work-info-des"><h1>What's the story here?</h1><h2 style="font-size:8px;text-align:justify;MARGIN-TOP:10PX">A 56 year old myopic teacher walked into my OPD recently. He was highly stressed and softly mumbled that he had a sudden loss of vision in his left eye (CFCF) which was the only seeing eye. The vision loss happened before 2 days with apparantly no other positive history. On examining his retina, the right eye had a scar over the macula, which is the central point of vision in the eye; while the left eye showed large area of bleed covering nearly 80-90% of the central retina. With help of clinical acumen and an OCT scan, we diagnosed him to have a condition called Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and soothingly explained him the entire problem.<br>Since the bleed was too large and was covering the central area of retina, the treatment was directed to achieve two main goals:<br>1. To displace the blood from the central area and clear the macula.<br>2. To dissolve the blood and solve the underlying problem.<br>We used 100% expansile C3F8 gas to reach Goal no 1 and injection Intravitreal Anti VEGF to reach Goal no 2. We advised him to stay in an upside down position (prone position) for a week, which would help in displacement of blood. Knowing the problem and solution so well now, he compliantly followed like literally his life depended on it! And Voila! The trick worked! 1 month later, he turned up with a vision of 6/36 and resolving hemorrhage. Now he was extremely motivated to go ahead with further treatment. So we continued with Anti VEGF injections to solve the underlying problem. After 3 injections, the vision improved to 6/18, which was decent enough to make his living worth it and happily continue his teaching profession! Someone has rightly said…It’s His will, His way, but Your faith! Blessed be the patient!<br>PCV is a dangerous retinal condition where a small blood vessel like structure called a polyp might rupture and cause bleeding or exudation over the retina. If not treated on time, it can cause permenent loss of vision. It is commonly found in smokers and hypertensives, and sometimes can also be found in myopics and elderly population. The treatment is mainly Intravitreal injections, but in certain tricky cases, gas displacement or lasers may help. If you happen to know people around who have such an issue, prompt them to take early treatment, otherwise permanent damage is bound to happen!</h2><h3>Catagory :<span>AGE-RELATED-MACULAR-DEGENERATION</span></h3></div></div><div class="work-info" id="ARMD3"><div class="work-info-img" style="background:url(w03.png);background-size:cover"></div><div class="work-info-des"><h1>What's the story here?</h1><h2 style="font-size:12px;text-align:justify">A 48 year old housewife noticed a small black spot in front of her eye. She tried to wash and rub her eye multiple times, but it just did not vanish. She hence consulted her local eye doctor, who said it is a retina a problem and you need to see a specialist as soon as possible. It was then she visited our OPD for consultation and we noticed her vision was down to 3/60. We noticed that there was a small bleed in the center of the retina, which on OCT scan was confirmed to be a membrane called Choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) or Membrane Neovasculare (MNV). The modern day treatment of such membranes is in form of Anti VEGF injections. The injection number can range from 3-4 to more than 10, depending on the severity of membrane and recurrence rate. Luckily, after 3 monthly injections, she had complete resolution of the membrane and bleed and the vision returned back to 6/9.

He explained me and my family that the eye is severely infected and has to be removed at any cost otherwise the infection might spread to the brain. My family was very shocked hearing that and refused at first, but he explained us the seriousness of the situation. Two days later, my lungs collapsed and I was put on ventilator. Since I couldn’t be shifted to the operation theatre, DrDhaivat came along with his team and arranged for a bedside surgery. It was God’s grace that the surgery went fine, and a week later, I was feeling much better. The ICU doctor told me that the infective origin might have been in the eye, and since it was removed, all my body started functioning better. Today after 1 year, I still call DrDhaivat Shah every few months to thank him to take that critical decision and save my life. I have one normal and one artificial eye today, and I am very thankful to God for this life."
